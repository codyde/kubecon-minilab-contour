# Introducing Project Contour

Contour is an Ingress controller for Kubernetes that works by deploying the Envoy proxy as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Contour supports dynamic configuration updates out of the box while maintaining a lightweight profile.

Contour also introduces a new ingress API (HTTPProxy) which is implemented via a Custom Resource Definition (CRD). Its goal is to expand upon the functionality of the Ingress API to allow for a richer user experience as well as solve shortcomings in the original design.

In this lab, we will be working with a simple HTTPProxy configuration for allowing access to a web based application hosted within a Kubernetes Cluster.
